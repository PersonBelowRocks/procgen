//! This module contains code related to the generator server's runtime. This includes the ECS world(s), ECS schedule(s), and async runtime for netcode.

// TODO: we should maybe have some kind of Runtime struct to store all the data and state for the runtime. We'll interact with this struct to add generators and stuff.
